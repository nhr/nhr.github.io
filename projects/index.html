<p>I&rsquo;m <a href="https://github.com/nhr">nhr</a> on GitHub. Here are some of my more interesting projects:</p>
<h3 id="shiftzillahttpsgithubcomnhrshiftzilla"><a href="https://github.com/nhr/shiftzilla">Shiftzilla</a><a href="#shiftzillahttpsgithubcomnhrshiftzilla" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>While I was part of the <a href="https://openshift.com/">OpenShift</a> team, I was responsible for managing several consecutive product releases. Understanding our progress against bug counts was critical to staying on top of our quarterly release cadence. I wrote Shiftzilla to start capturing Bugzilla-based info and offering us a way to analyze long-time trends on a per-release and per-development-team basis.</p>
<h3 id="asciibinderhttpsasciibindernet"><a href="https://asciibinder.net">AsciiBinder</a><a href="#asciibinderhttpsasciibindernet" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Another problem we had to solve for OpenShift was managing <a href="https://docs.openshift.com">documentation</a> for several different versions of the product at once. The fantastic <a href="https://asciidoctor.org">AsciiDoctor</a> tool could handle converting markdown pages (specifically, AsciiDoc pages) to HTML, but there was no utility at the time that could compile a bunch of AsciiDoctor-generated pages into a single website. I created AsciiBinder to solve that problem.</p>
<h3 id="the-swn-sector-generatorhttpsswnemichroncom"><a href="https://swn.emichron.com/">The SWN Sector Generator</a><a href="#the-swn-sector-generatorhttpsswnemichroncom" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Totally not work-related, but very relevant to one of my hobbies. I took the open-sourced rules for a role playing game called <a href="http://www.sinenomine-pub.com/?page_id=395">Stars Without Number</a> and created this galaxy generator that has been running almost continuously since 2010.</p>
<h1 id="non-coding-projects">Non-Coding Projects<a href="#non-coding-projects" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<h3 id="quarantine-dance-mix">Quarantine Dance Mix<a href="#quarantine-dance-mix" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>My DJ persona is <a href="https://www.fathercashmere.com/">Father Cashmere</a> (my kids came up with it). Starting in April of 2020 I started live streaming a DJ set every Friday night. This was the birth of a listening party / Zoom hangout that has come to be known as the Quarantine Dance Mix. We all thought the pandemic would be behind us after a few months, and I thought the same thing about my DJ sets. But COVID-19 is still here and so I&rsquo;m still doing these sets on Friday nights. You can learn more about that at the Father Cashmere website.</p>
<h3 id="spartanhttpsspartancom-obstacle-course-racing"><a href="https://spartan.com">Spartan</a> Obstacle Course Racing<a href="#spartanhttpsspartancom-obstacle-course-racing" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Since 2010 I have participated in at least one obstacle course per year. In 2019 I completed my first Spartan Trifecta, and was scheduled to give it another shot in 2020. Here&rsquo;s hoping 2021 will work out a little better! Training for events like this has been incredibly helpful for me to keep myself sane during a very crazy year.</p>
