<p>In October of 2018, I got my annual physical and came face-to-face with the reality of my current weight and fitness levels. I was at 30 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">BMI</a> and at my lowest amount of regular physical activity in years. The trend was not good.</p>
<p>My wife encouraged me to try <a href="https://noom.com/">Noom</a> ‚Äì I signed up for it the same day as my physical ‚Äì and the support and coaching that I got through that little mobile app was transformational. It wasn‚Äôt just about reducing calories and increasing activity; it was complete <em>mindset</em> shift. I think about food differently now.</p>
<p>I had set myself up for extremely gradual weight loss. I figured that this was a marathon, not a sprint. By March of 2019 I was already seeing major improvements in the way I looked and felt. And so I made a crazy commitment to myself. 2019 was going to be the year that I completed my first <a href="https://www.spartan.com/en/obstacle-course-races/trifecta">Spartan Trifecta</a>.</p>
<p>I had run Spartan Sprints ‚Äì 3 to 5 mile obstacle course races ‚Äì in the past. But never a Super (8 to 12 miles) and certainly never a Beast (13 plus miles). And now I was going to do all of them in a calendar year. This goal scared me a little bit, but then ‚Äì fear is a great motivator üôÇ</p>
<p>The photo above is me finishing the final obstacle of the Mt. Killington Beast in September. I had dropped 30 pounds in 11 months, and I was just about to complete a 30-obstacle course. One obstacle for every pound. And this is me crossing the finish line:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I‚Äôm putting this here mostly as a reminder to myself ‚Äì that at age 45, I accomplished this. And moreover, if I want to maintain what I‚Äôve achieved, I need to keep finding the edges of my comfort zone and pushing past them. So yeah, I‚Äôm already signed up for a 2020 trifecta üôÇ</p>
<p>Hey reader ‚Äì if you‚Äôre motivated too ‚Äì embrace patience, embrace focus, and crush those challenges!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
