      <description>My hunt for a shiny new laptop always starts with the best of intentions, but well-intentioned laptops usually don‚Äôt come with gaming-ready GPUs. What do I mean by a ‚Äúwell-intentioned‚Äù laptop? I have a lot of respect for System76 and Star Labs for their lovely Linux-first systems, and particular respect for Purism‚Äòs holistic approach to the union of open source hardware and privacy. But I‚Äôd be lying to myself if I didn‚Äôt admit that my ideal laptop is just as capable of running triple-A video games as it is of running Linux-based workloads.</description>

      <description>In October of 2018, I got my annual physical and came face-to-face with the reality of my current weight and fitness levels. I was at 30 BMI and at my lowest amount of regular physical activity in years. The trend was not good.
My wife encouraged me to try Noom ‚Äì I signed up for it the same day as my physical ‚Äì and the support and coaching that I got through that little mobile app was transformational.</description>

      <description>Cocktail Hour Here at The Internet Shipyards, Friday night is cocktail night. Today‚Äôs special guest: the Rusty Nail, also known as the World‚Äôs Simplest Cocktail.
 1 part Drambuie 1 part cheap scotch  I can‚Äôt overstate how cheap the scotch should be. If it doesn‚Äôt come in a bottle with a white label that says ‚ÄúSCOTCH‚Äù on it, it‚Äôs probably too fancy for this cocktail.

      <description>Starting back in September I published a series of articles for the Red Hat Developer Blog under the series title ‚ÄúThat App You Love‚Äù. I‚Äôm psyched to announce that ‚ÄúThat App You Wrote‚Äù, my followup presentation, has been accepted as a talk at [DevConf.cz](https://devconf.cz) this month! Didn‚Äôt read the original series? You can follow along here:

      <description>We lost Mia today. I‚Äôve always read posts like this with some amount of indifference because in the back of my head I am thinking ‚Äúthis is just an animal‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is not a person‚Äù. And so I forgive you for feeling the same way. I understand that response.
This stream of thoughts is really for me, and it is also for my wife and kids and anyone else who feels the loss of our ‚Äújust a cat‚Äù as acutely as I am feeling it right now.</description>

      <description>In Decemeber of 2014 I transitioned from fifteen years of being a developer into being one of the people managers on a really amazing team here at Red Hat. All told, my first year in this role has been a tremendous learning experience for me. If you are interested in becoming a part of a team like this one, here is some advice for you based on the dozens of interviews I have conducted over my first 15 months.</description>

      <title>Comments on Backing Up a Linux Laptop</title>

      <description>My primary workhorse right now is an HP Omen running Fedora 22. Thinking and talking about how to restore my work environment from a total failure, I came to the conclusion that there are three primary things that need to be preserved:
Item 1: My entire user directory under /home, since that‚Äôs where all my stuff is.
Solution: Crashplan is impressing me ‚Äì slick commercial-quality UI, completely free for mounted ‚Äúlocal‚Äù disk backups and peer-to-peer backups through their central broker.</description>

      <description>I almost feel like a traitor, which is a weird way to feel about consumer electronics. But my next laptop is not going to be a MacBook. Our current development work on OpenShift requires easy access to a docker service, and Boot2docker just doesn‚Äôt cut it.
Apple provides an excellent ecosystem of interrelated apps; they find ways to make it easy to move content from one app to another that seem intuitive.</description>

      <title>iCloud ‚ÄúFamily Sharing‚Äù: Great Feature Unless You Use iTunes Match</title>

      <description>Family Sharing provides users with a way to share purchases from their iCloud/iTunes account with up to five other people. Additionally, this feature enables you to create iCloud accounts for children, and to manage the purchases and content available to those accounts.
iTunes has been around a lot longer than this feature, and so for years now, people have had to a different means to share app purchases across multiple users.</description>

      <title>Where to Post? Finding Yourself Amongst Ello, Facebook, and the Glut of Social Media</title>

      <guid>/2014/10/11/where-to-post-finding-yourself-amongst-ello/</guid>
      <description>Ello is a social platform that has been the subject of some buzz recently. Either by design or by accident, Ello is squarely positioned as the anti-Facebook, which immediately places it in a similar space in people‚Äôs minds. That‚Äôs a great deal for Ello, because feature-wise they have a long way to go before the can really throw down: no mobile app, no OAuth, no API. Ello claims to be built on a Freemium model that will sustain the company without them resorting to selling user info; but only time will tell.</description>

      <title>OS X to Fedora 20: The User Experience, Part 2</title>

      <description>Just tuning in? Have a look at Part 1 to find out how I installed Fedora 20 on a MacBook Air and why I am so interested in trying to duplicate or even surpass the user experience that I previously enjoyed with OS X.
The Cloud Cloud-based mail, calendaring and file synching have really levelled the playing field between the desktop OSes. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are using OS X or Linux if you read your e-mail in a web browser.</description>

      <title>OS X to Fedora 20: The User Experience, Part 1</title>
      <link>/2014/08/18/os-x-to-fedora-20-the-user-experience-part-1/</link>

      <guid>/2014/08/18/os-x-to-fedora-20-the-user-experience-part-1/</guid>
      <description>A little background here: I have been a Mac enthusiast for a number of years now. I would not say that I am religious about OS X, but if the OS X user experience is a philosophical application of ‚Äúopinionated software‚Äù, then I find myself in agreement with most of the opinions that the Apple UX team has expressed.
However, I am also an open source developer. I‚Äôd like to believe that it is possible to create a similar and possibly even superior experience with a Linux-based desktop environment.</description>
