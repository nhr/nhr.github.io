      <description>My primary workhorse right now is an HP Omen running Fedora 22. Thinking and talking about how to restore my work environment from a total failure, I came to the conclusion that there are three primary things that need to be preserved:
Item 1: My entire user directory under /home, since that’s where all my stuff is.
Solution: Crashplan is impressing me – slick commercial-quality UI, completely free for mounted “local” disk backups and peer-to-peer backups through their central broker.</description>

      <description>I almost feel like a traitor, which is a weird way to feel about consumer electronics. But my next laptop is not going to be a MacBook. Our current development work on OpenShift requires easy access to a docker service, and Boot2docker just doesn’t cut it.
Apple provides an excellent ecosystem of interrelated apps; they find ways to make it easy to move content from one app to another that seem intuitive.</description>

      <description>Just tuning in? Have a look at Part 1 to find out how I installed Fedora 20 on a MacBook Air and why I am so interested in trying to duplicate or even surpass the user experience that I previously enjoyed with OS X.
The Cloud Cloud-based mail, calendaring and file synching have really levelled the playing field between the desktop OSes. It doesn’t matter if you are using OS X or Linux if you read your e-mail in a web browser.</description>

      <description>A little background here: I have been a Mac enthusiast for a number of years now. I would not say that I am religious about OS X, but if the OS X user experience is a philosophical application of “opinionated software”, then I find myself in agreement with most of the opinions that the Apple UX team has expressed.
However, I am also an open source developer. I’d like to believe that it is possible to create a similar and possibly even superior experience with a Linux-based desktop environment.</description>
